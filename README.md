# Mantis IAP Day 2 Workshop: Mantis GitHub Vertical

This repository contains scripts and material used for the Day 2 Workshop for the Mantis IAP at MIT:
* A Python (Jupyter) notebook that can be used to get GitHub issues via Google Colab (Cloud) or Jupyter Notebook, generating a CSV to upload to Mantis.
* A sample CSV of data that can be made with the Jupyter notebook, using Issues data from Microsoft's VSCode repository.

## Instructions
1) Download the .ipynb file from this repository and upload it to **Google Colab (RECOMMENDED)**: https://colab.research.google.com/, or clone this repository to run the Python Notebook locally.
2) Follow all instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to generate a CSV of GitHub issues and download it to your computer (if using Colab)
3) Go to https://mantis.csail.mit.edu and log into your Mantis account. If you need an account, you can use the Request Beta Access form here: https://home.withmantis.com/
4) In Mantis, click the "+" icon to make a space.
5) After clicking "Get Started," click "Upload Documents," and then "CSV/XLSX."
6) Give your project and space a name.
7) Upload the CSV you created with the Jupyter Notebook.
8) Click the "AUTO-SELECT TYPES" Button
9) If you want other people to view the space, set it to public.
10) Toggle Route to GPU for faster Space Creation.
11) Click "Create Project"
12) You will be redirected to a progress page, where you can check out the progress of your space while it's getting created! You will use the space you create of GitHub issues in the rest of this workshop.
